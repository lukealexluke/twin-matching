Implementing the Twin-Matching Procedure
The Twin-Matching Procedure was first used in [Brexit and the contraction of syndicated lending](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X21000994) (Berg et al.) The logistics of the procedure are documented in the [Online Appendix](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3611663).

Twin-Matching follows a similar process as traditional matching, but instead of matching on observable characteristics, treatment and control units are matched based on the path of the outcome variable, which implicitly matches on any important observable or unobservable factors. This method can be used for many different panel set-ups where pre-event data is available.
